Since 1928, this Hawaiian tradition has been in full bloom, with leis—or garlands made of flowers, leaves or shells—serving as symbols of connection. The idea for Lei Day came from poet Don Blanding, who suggested a holiday dedicated to Hawaii's iconic floral garlands. Local writer Grace Tower Warren gave it its slogan, 'May Day is Lei Day in Hawaii,' and the tradition quickly took root.","date":"May 1, 2025","bsTitle":"A fragrant tradition","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250501_PinkPlumeria%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"a27b6966feae903111826d239f51a0d6","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.PinkPlumeria_EN-CA9604595582_tmb.jpg","title":"Lei Day","desc":"Today, while the world celebrates May Day with parades and protests, Hawaii, in the United States, takes a more fragrant approach—by draping…","hash":"BR9bo5Wn+6HBhFe1M6UJlebmcj+FTfy7Hlk5g8U4G3Q="}},{"startdate":"20250430","fullstartdate":"202504300400","enddate":"20250501","url":"/th?id=OHR.ColtraneBand_EN-CA8272011820_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.ColtraneBand_EN-CA8272011820","copyright":"Jazz saxophonist John Coltrane and band performing in 1961 in London, England (© Popperfoto/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=International+Jazz+Day&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220250430_0400%22","title":"All that jazz and more","caption":"International Jazz Day","copyrightonly":"© Popperfoto/Getty Images","desc":"It's time to jazz up—literally.
