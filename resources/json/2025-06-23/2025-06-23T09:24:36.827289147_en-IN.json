Sea turtles, like this one photographed in Fernando de Noronha, Brazil, have been cruising Earth's oceans since before T-rex was a thing. Today, World Sea Turtle Day, is about recognising these ancient navigators and the role they play in keeping our oceans in balance. Why June 16? The date marks the birthday of American conservationist Archie Carr, known as the 'father of sea turtle conservation.' His work laid the foundation for understanding turtle behaviour and fighting for their protection. There are seven species of sea turtles gliding through the world's oceans: green, loggerhead, hawksbill, leatherback, Kemp's ridley, olive ridley and flatback. Most of them are either endangered or vulnerable.","date":"Jun 16, 2025","bsTitle":"Ancient swimmers, modern struggles","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250615_SeaTurtleBrazil%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"7da64b2bf887b141b62166cb12fb1e16","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SeaTurtleBrazil_EN-IN8664549604_tmb.jpg","title":"World Sea Turtle Day","desc":"They've got built-in helmets, a slow-and-steady vibe and zero interest in your deadlines.
