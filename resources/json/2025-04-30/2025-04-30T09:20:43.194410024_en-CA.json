This music form emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in New Orleans, United States, a city alive with musical traditions from Africa, Europe and the Caribbean. Rooted in blues and ragtime, jazz quickly evolved, with pioneers like Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald giving it a voice. Canada embraced jazz early on, with Montreal becoming a jazz hotspot by the 1920s.
