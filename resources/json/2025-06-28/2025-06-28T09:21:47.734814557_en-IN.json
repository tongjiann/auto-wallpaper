Males typically weigh up to 1,300 kilograms and can reach heights of 5.5 metres. In the wild, they live around 30 years, often longer in captivity. A notable feature is its long neck, made up of seven vertebrae, which accounts for about one-third of its total height.","date":"Jun 19, 2025","bsTitle":"Spot the spots","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250618_SerengetiGiraffe%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"a5e42c8a33caf31e4b256ac4690a268c","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SerengetiGiraffe_EN-IN1923240372_tmb.jpg","title":"Masai giraffe mother grooming her calf in the Serengeti, Tanzania","desc":"Masai giraffes, known for their distinctive, jagged blotches, are native to East Africa.

The date marks the birthday of American conservationist Archie Carr, known as the 'father of sea turtle conservation.' His work laid the foundation for understanding turtle behaviour and fighting for their protection. There are seven species of sea turtles gliding through the world's oceans: green, loggerhead, hawksbill, leatherback, Kemp's ridley, olive ridley and flatback.
