The date marks the birthday of American conservationist Archie Carr, known as the 'father of sea turtle conservation.' His work laid the foundation for understanding turtle behaviour and fighting for their protection. There are seven species of sea turtles gliding through the world's oceans: green, loggerhead, hawksbill, leatherback, Kemp's ridley, olive ridley and flatback.
