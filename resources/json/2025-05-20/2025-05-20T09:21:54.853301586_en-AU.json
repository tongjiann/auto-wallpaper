Established on this day in 1959, Torres del Paine National Park in Patagonia spans over 181,000 hectares. Originally called Grey Lake National Tourism Park, it was renamed in 1970 and later designated a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve in 1978. Its most recognisable feature—the three massive granite peaks known as the Torres—stands over 2,400 metres tall. These formations took shape through magma intrusion and uplift, followed by millions of years of glacial erosion, leaving behind the jagged spires seen today.","date":"13 May 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250513_TorresChile%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"af7daee7faddde4a4d402621918b1a99","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.TorresChile_ROW1542406588_tmb.jpg","title":"Torres del Paine National Park, Patagonia, Chile","desc":"Wildlife roams freely in one of Chile's most stunning protected areas, where towering peaks and ancient glaciers shape the land.

Native to the Mediterranean Basin and areas around the Red Sea, it holds the unique distinction of being the only living member of the Chamaeleonidae family with a range that naturally extends into Europe. Did you know? These reptiles don't change colour to match their background. Instead, their shifting shades help regulate body temperature, attract mates and communicate with others. Specialised skin cells, including iridophores, reflect light to create dazzling displays. Some species turn bright to signal aggression, while others adopt subdued tones to avoid attention.","date":"9 May 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250509_CuteChameleon%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"1c07a3f9efe6371a0c50067c371992b7","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CuteChameleon_ROW1187916119_tmb.jpg","title":"Common chameleon","desc":"Chameleons are remarkable creatures, best known for their ability to change colour and their distinctive physical traits.
