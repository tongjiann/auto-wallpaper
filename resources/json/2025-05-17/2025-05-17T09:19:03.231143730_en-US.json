Designed in the Beaux-Arts and American Renaissance styles, the Capitol integrates modern materials like iron, glass, and steel. The term 'Beaux-Arts' was not used when the Capitol was built, but the style gained popularity, partly due to the architecture showcased at the 1893 Chicago World's Columbian Exposition. Architect Cass Gilbert's design features a remarkable dome, which is inspired by St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican City. Featured in today's image, it is the second-largest self-supported marble dome in the world.","date":"May 10, 2025","bsTitle":"Gilded glory","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250510_MinnesotaRotunda%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"e65c68f90d6f39267873363fd97d6385","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MinnesotaRotunda_EN-US6605011856_tmb.jpg","title":"Minnesota State Capitol in St. Paul, Minnesota","desc":"A grand and gilded sight—the heart of the Minnesota State Capitol is waiting to be explored.

Unlike horses, which might bolt at danger, donkeys take a moment to assess the situation before reacting. From ancient trade routes to modern farms, donkeys have been essential to transportation and agriculture. In many parts of the world, they're still the backbone of rural economies, carrying supplies across difficult terrain where vehicles can't go. Despite their vital role, donkeys face serious challenges. Many endure overwork, poor treatment, and abandonment.","date":"May 8, 2025","bsTitle":"A day to bray about","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250508_RhyoliteDonkeys%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"81f4b70c19ead381660f0afcb3cb9e71","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.RhyoliteDonkeys_EN-US6439068828_tmb.jpg","title":"World Donkey Day","desc":"On May 8 each year, donkeys get their moment in the sun—though they'd probably prefer the shade.

The battle itself was brief, lasting from daybreak to early evening, but the Mexican army, led by General Ignacio Zaragoza, managed to defeat a much larger and better-equipped French force. Today, Cinco de Mayo festivities feature parades, mariachi music, folk dancing, and delicious foods like tacos and mole poblano.
