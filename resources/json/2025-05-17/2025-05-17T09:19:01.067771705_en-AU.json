The lagoon isn't just a scenic wonder—it's a place steeped in history and innovation. Formed after the last Ice Age, it became a refuge for people fleeing invasions around the time of the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 CE. In the centuries that followed, those early settlers began building what would eventually become the iconic city of Venice.","date":"17 May 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250517_VeniceLagoon%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"d199e902369aa782edc31536f2dcf923","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.VeniceLagoon_ROW6294338902_tmb.jpg","title":"A delta in the Venetian Lagoon, Italy","desc":"Pictured here is a spectacular view of a delta in the Venetian Lagoon, Italy.

This macaw species is known for its mostly green plumage, with a bold reddish forehead and soft pale blue hues on its lower back, rump and upper tail feathers. They have incredibly powerful beaks, practically built like nature’s nutcracker, which helps them open even the toughest nuts. Native to the tropical forests of Central and South America, this colourful parrot is critically endangered, with fewer than 1,000 individuals estimated in the wild. These intelligent, social birds depend heavily on old-growth forests, particularly in places like Costa Rica, where they nest in almendro trees.","date":"16 May 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250516_GreenMacaw%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"f9621581721fca6b28a5d63cbe38c0ed","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.GreenMacaw_ROW6177034783_tmb.jpg","title":"Great green macaw, Mexico","desc":"The stunning bird, featured in today's image, is the great green macaw.
