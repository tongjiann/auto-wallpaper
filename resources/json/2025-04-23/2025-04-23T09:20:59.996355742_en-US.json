The event was initiated by Jennifer Barlow, a high school student in 2003, to combat light pollution. One of the best places to experience the night sky's beauty is Joshua Tree National Park in southeastern California, an International Dark Sky Park. Here, the absence of artificial light allows visitors to see the stars as our ancestors once did. Did you know that light pollution prevents us from seeing most of the stars in the Milky Way? By reducing it, we can reconnect with the universe's beauty and wonder.","date":"Apr 21, 2025","bsTitle":"Under the spell of the Milky Way","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250421_JoshuaStars%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"71b25625bfa9a9905d3239b8e2abf305","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.JoshuaStars_EN-US2563220033_tmb.jpg","title":"International Dark Sky Week","desc":"Imagine standing under a sky so dark that the Milky Way stretches across it like a luminous ribbon.
