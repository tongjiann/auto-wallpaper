During the breeding season, males turn into tireless singers, hoping to win a mate with their sweet tunes. When it's time to nest, females carefully weave small cup-shaped homes from grass, plant fibres and feathers, ensuring a cosy spot for their eggs. But here's something impressive—yellow warblers won't tolerate freeloaders. If a brown-headed cowbird sneaks an egg into their nest, these clever birds simply build a new layer over it, protecting their own offspring. As summer ends, they embark on a journey south to Central and South America, spending the colder months basking in warmer climates before returning.","date":"20 Apr 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250420_YellowWarbler%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"162aba110979b098f52580c544b79399","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.YellowWarbler_ROW3132425719_tmb.jpg","title":"Yellow warbler in Canada","desc":"Yellow warbler—featured in today's image—is a tiny songbird that brightens the landscape with its vibrant colour.

Kachina, pictured here, is equidistant from Sipapu and Owachomo. It was named after the petroglyphs and pictographs found at its base. Owachomo is believed to be the oldest of the three. Its thin, arching structure suggests it may eventually collapse.
