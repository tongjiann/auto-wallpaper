Enter Mona Vale rockpool in Sydney, Australia—a watery paradox where the ocean is wild beyond the walls and well-behaved within its calm, contained edges. Perched between two beaches—The Basin beach and Mona Vale Beach—this rock pool feels more like a natural wonder than a man-made one. Built in the 1930s during the Depression, it was carved out of a natural rock shelf as part of an unemployment relief scheme. Upgraded over time, the pool is more than 30 metres long and flanked by a smaller children's pool. The pools were also used by large numbers of World War II troops who camped nearby. They are free, open year-round and cleaned regularly by both council crews and the ocean itself. So next time you are in Sydney, make a splash where the waves meet the wall. It's a shore thing.","date":"May 27, 2025","bsTitle":"A shore thing","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250527_MonaValePool%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"844a1d8a33e2b4f14627e0b04e5072b2","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MonaValePool_EN-CA6791615646_tmb.jpg","title":"Mona Vale rockpool, Sydney, Australia","desc":"Ever wanted to swim in the ocean without accidentally tasting half of it?
