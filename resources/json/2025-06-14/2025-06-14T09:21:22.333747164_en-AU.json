Home to towering pines and rugged ridgelines, this forest also hosts a stretch of the legendary Pacific Crest Trail (PCT). Winding over 4,200 kilometres from Mexico to Canada, the PCT is the ultimate thru-hike dream. Designated a National Scenic Trail in 1968, it traverses seven national parks, 25 national forests and provides a unique lens through which to experience the dramatic landscapes of the American West. Known officially as the Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail, the PCT runs through the states of California, Oregon and Washington. Some of the notable locations on or near the trail are Big Bear Lake, South Sierra Wilderness, Walker Pass and Mount Rainier National Park.","date":"7 Jun 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250607_PacificCrestTrail%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"786078354e43dd9c14c0aced535f099a","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.PacificCrestTrail_ROW1631856584_tmb.jpg","title":"Summit of Pine Mountain, Angeles National Forest, California, United States","desc":"Today's image takes us to the Angeles National Forest in California, United States.

Originally from Asia, the ring-necked pheasant was introduced to France during the Middle Ages. Today, it is a common sight in rural landscapes, particularly in Normandy, where it finds refuge in hedgerows, field edges and flowering meadows. Although it is not a threatened species, its survival depends on the quality of agricultural areas. The loss of hedges, wasteland and fallow fields reduces areas where it can nest and seek shelter.","date":"6 Jun 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250606_Pheasant%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"35dbefacb7be06a9e08a7477d59f22a9","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.Pheasant_ROW1557701381_tmb.jpg","title":"Common pheasant, Normandy, France","desc":"Today's image features a common pheasant in Normandy, France.

Today, it impresses visitors with its Baroque architecture and idyllic location on an artificial island. Majestic towers and halls, furnished with precious furniture and trophies, bear witness to the former splendour of the Saxon court.

These flowers bloom during summer, providing long-lasting colour and attracting bees, butterflies and hummingbirds. They are also appreciated for their low-maintenance nature and ability to naturalize. Unfortunately, wild Echinacea populations are under growing threat from excessive harvesting. In addition, habitat loss and environmental changes caused by human activity also threaten the long-term survival of some species.","date":"2 Jun 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250602_EchinaceaButterfly%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"13197ce78f65c49bc3684f8fbb140504","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.EchinaceaButterfly_ROW1204867098_tmb.jpg","title":"Skipper butterfly on an Echinacea flower","desc":"Pictured here is a skipper butterfly, known for its quick, darting flight, resting on a vibrant Echinacea, or coneflower, at Rockefeller…","hash":"D+gXzJDLhV0fPrO4MuxEkWREsjymn256bsCFqj9kpnw="}},{"startdate":"20250601","fullstartdate":"202506010700","enddate":"20250602","url":"/th?id=OHR.GrandeTerreReef_ROW1096147222_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.GrandeTerreReef_ROW1096147222","copyright":"Barrier reef off Grande Terre, New Caledonia, France (© Karsten Wrobel/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=New+Caledonian+barrier+reef&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220250601_0700%22","title":"Info","caption":"Barrier reef off Grande Terre, New Caledonia, France","copyrightonly":"© Karsten Wrobel/Getty Images","desc":"'Life under the sea is better than anything they got up there,' Sebastian the crab once told Ariel.
