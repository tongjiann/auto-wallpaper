They offer the perfect refuge from the summer heat and crowded beaches. Each tower has its own story to tell: of ancient civilisations, adventurous hikers, daring climbers and distant battles. Shaped by time and weather, these Dolomite spires played a strategic role during the First World War, and it is still possible today to explore the trenches and remnants of that conflict-scarred past. However, nature is stronger than history: green pastures embrace the towers, the wind carries the scent of pines and a clear sky opens above paths that beckon you to explore. Streams meander through flower-filled meadows while birdsong accompanies every step.","date":"Jun. 14, 2025","bsTitle":"The sounds of silence","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250614_DolomitiEstate%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"362d5fd7f82e5e1b09dbd799a9505ac2","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.DolomitiEstate_EN-CA4112246625_tmb.jpg","title":"Cinque Torri, Dolomites, Italy","desc":"The Five Towers, known as 'Fünf Türme' in German and 'Cinc Toires' in Ladin, rise majestically in the heart of the Dolomites in the province…","hash":"1+0Vp8h7s7S9pS8Lz5i/MhniyqaHHLefmqfXcQAiVQo="}},{"startdate":"20250613","fullstartdate":"202506130400","enddate":"20250614","url":"/th?id=OHR.CanadianGPQuebec_EN-CA4428568673_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.CanadianGPQuebec_EN-CA4428568673","copyright":"Montreal skyline reflecting in St. Lawrence River, Quebec (© Walter Bibikow/Stone/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Canadian+Grand+Prix+2025&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220250613_0400%22","title":"From city streets to racing seats","caption":"Canadian Grand Prix 2025","copyrightonly":"© Walter Bibikow/Stone/Getty Images","desc":"When 20 of the world's fastest cars hit the grid, it is not just racing—it's Formula 1.
