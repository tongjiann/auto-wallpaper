The event was initiated by Jennifer Barlow, an American high school student, in 2003, to combat light pollution. One of the best places to experience the night sky's beauty is in the United States, in Joshua Tree National Park in southeastern California, which is an International Dark Sky Park. Here, the absence of artificial light allows visitors to see the stars as our ancestors once did. Did you know that light pollution prevents us from seeing most of the stars in the Milky Way?
