Named after Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan, these medium-sized penguins were first documented in 1520. They can grow up to 76 centimetres tall and weigh around 6 kilograms. Skilled hunters, they thrive on a diet of small fish, squid and krill, efficiently filtering seawater with their specialised salt-excreting glands. With the abundant marine life along South America's Atlantic coast, they have a reliable food source. While these flightless creatures may not soar in the skies, they certainly capture hearts.","date":"25 Apr 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250425_MagellanicPenguin%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"66db151cda0d8e6b491a10222d91ae32","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MagellanicPenguin_ROW3755492915_tmb.jpg","title":"Magellanic penguins, Volunteer Point, Falkland Islands","desc":"Cute, clumsy and completely captivating, penguins always steal the show.

During the breeding season, males turn into tireless singers, hoping to win a mate with their sweet tunes. When it's time to nest, females carefully weave small cup-shaped homes from grass, plant fibres and feathers, ensuring a cosy spot for their eggs. But here's something impressive—yellow warblers won't tolerate freeloaders. If a brown-headed cowbird sneaks an egg into their nest, these clever birds simply build a new layer over it, protecting their own offspring. As summer ends, they embark on a journey south to Central and South America, spending the colder months basking in warmer climates before returning.","date":"20 Apr 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250420_YellowWarbler%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"162aba110979b098f52580c544b79399","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.YellowWarbler_ROW3132425719_tmb.jpg","title":"Yellow warbler in Canada","desc":"Yellow warbler—featured in today's image—is a tiny songbird that brightens the landscape with its vibrant colour.
