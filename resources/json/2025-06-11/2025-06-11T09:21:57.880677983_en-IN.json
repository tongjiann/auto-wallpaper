Literally. On one leg. These long-legged locals, the greater flamingos, bring a splash of pink to Namibia's windswept Atlantic coast. These birds are the largest of their kind, and they're not shy about showing off. Towering over 120 centimetres tall with spoon-shaped bills and stilt-like legs, they're easy to spot. That bubblegum pink hue? That's all diet. Flamingos feed on algae, crustaceans and tiny invertebrates packed with carotenoids—the same pigments that make carrots orange. The more they eat, the pinker they get. In other words, they're what they eat, right down to the blush. In the air, flamingos are sleek flyers, cruising long distances in a V-formation. Their migration habits are still being studied, but it's clear they go where the wetlands flow—from inland salt pans to coastal sanctuaries, always in search of food and safe nesting zones.","date":"Jun 11, 2025","bsTitle":"A tidal ballet","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250610_FlamingosNamibia%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"7ec172a04a1114e4a98d1f313c004fbd","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.FlamingosNamibia_EN-IN8571629692_tmb.jpg","title":"Greater flamingos, Lüderitz, Namibia","desc":"In Lüderitz, Namibia, these birds aren't just passing through—they're standing their ground.

Often referred to as 'River of Grass,' the park's unique ecosystem, fed by a slow-moving river from Lake Okeechobee to Florida Bay, is a significant breeding ground for tropical wading birds. The park also plays a crucial role in water conservation and flood control, as its wetlands serve as natural filters and buffers against storms.","date":"Jun 10, 2025","bsTitle":"A river of grass","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250609_AerialEverglades%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"4cd8d472384829a09f2462c7c58fb3be","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.AerialEverglades_EN-IN8448560441_tmb.jpg","title":"Everglades National Park, Florida, United States","desc":"Wouldn't it be great to see our reflection from above in this vast expanse of water?
