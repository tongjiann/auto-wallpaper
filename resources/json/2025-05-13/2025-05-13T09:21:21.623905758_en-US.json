Originally called Grey Lake National Tourism Park, it was renamed in 1970 and later designated a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve in 1978. Its most recognizable feature—the three massive granite peaks known as the Torres—stands over 8,000 feet tall. These formations took shape through magma intrusion and uplift, followed by millions of years of glacial erosion, leaving behind the jagged spires seen today.","date":"May 13, 2025","bsTitle":"66 and still gorgeous","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250513_TorresChile%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"804531558f24d864626909fc74f3b7ee","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.TorresChile_EN-US6814348961_tmb.jpg","title":"Torres del Paine National Park in Patagonia, Chile","desc":"Wildlife roams freely in one of Chile's most stunning protected areas, where towering peaks and ancient glaciers shape the land.

Unlike horses, which might bolt at danger, donkeys take a moment to assess the situation before reacting. From ancient trade routes to modern farms, donkeys have been essential to transportation and agriculture. In many parts of the world, they're still the backbone of rural economies, carrying supplies across difficult terrain where vehicles can't go.
