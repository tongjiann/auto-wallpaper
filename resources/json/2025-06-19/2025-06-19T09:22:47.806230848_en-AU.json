Long before European ships appeared on the horizon, the Carijós—skilled fishermen and farmers of the Tupi-Guarani group—lived here. By 1529, explorers had charted these waters and the name 'Santa Catarina' appeared on world maps. In the 18th century, waves of Azorean settlers arrived. The coast became a stage for disputes between Portugal and Spain, and in the centuries that followed, German and Italian immigrants added new colours to the region's tapestry. Fishing communities and ports flourished throughout the 19th and 20th centuries.","date":"19 Jun 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250619_WinterBegins%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"81c3ca9f0f2baa65485ea0bb645733a3","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.WinterBegins_ROW5099492663_tmb.jpg","title":"Beach in Santa Catarina, Brazil","desc":"Stretching over 560 kilometres along Brazil's southern Atlantic, Santa Catarina's coast is a place shaped by history and change.

Found across Northeast Asia and even parts of Hawaii, this striking butterfly is known for its vivid colouration and powerful flight, making it a frequent visitor to both urban gardens and wild habitats. While it is common and not currently threatened, its role as a pollinator is no less important. The Asian swallowtail uses sophisticated colour vision and colour constancy to identify flowers, especially those in the citrus family, even under changing light conditions. This remarkable ability allows it to remain an effective pollinator across a wide range of environments. Delicate yet determined, the Asian swallowtail reminds us that even the smallest pollinators play a big role in keeping nature balanced and beautiful.","date":"18 Jun 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250618_AsianSwallowtail%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"10e8c3e67d3c9e7691dc557ffe25a5b5","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.AsianSwallowtail_ROW5026758014_tmb.jpg","title":"Asian swallowtail butterfly","desc":"Featured here is the Asian swallowtail, beautifully captured on a red spider lily.
