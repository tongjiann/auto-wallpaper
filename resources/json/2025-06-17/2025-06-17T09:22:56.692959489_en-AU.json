It protects the southern 20% of the original Everglades and is home to numerous rare and endangered species, including the Florida panther, American crocodile and West Indian manatee. Often referred to as 'River of Grass,' the park's unique ecosystem, fed by a slow-moving river from Lake Okeechobee to Florida Bay, is a significant breeding ground for tropical wading birds. Everglades National Park is not only a national treasure but also an international one, recognised as a World Heritage Site, an International Biosphere Reserve and a Wetland of International Importance.","date":"10 Jun 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250610_AerialEverglades%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"eb8f172c96cedae2a1adfbaa43fcbe97","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.AerialEverglades_ROW1882187380_tmb.jpg","title":"Everglades National Park, Florida, United States","desc":"Wouldn't it be great to see our reflection from above in this vast expanse of water?

The Walls of Dubrovnik, built between the 13th and 17th centuries, stretch for almost 2 kilometres, with towers, forts and bastions still standing strong.

These marine mammals are heavy—females average more than 260 kilograms, while males are around 540 kilograms. Males are noticeably larger than females and are known for their loud roars and flatter snouts. Their deep vocalisations include belching, growling and snorting to warn others and communicate underwater. Males get loud to defend turf, while moms and pups use unique calls to find each other in a crowded rookery. Despite their size, they're preyed on by orcas and large sharks. These sea lions are considered near-threatened. Ocean conservation keeps them—and countless other mammals—afloat.","date":"8 Jun 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250608_StellarSeaLions%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"a9a54e11a5529c1768f2e1968a0f1056","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.StellarSeaLions_ROW1703622183_tmb.jpg","title":"Steller sea lions","desc":"Steller sea lions might look like laid-back loungers on rocky shores, but they are noisy and nosy.
