Lead, zinc, coal, sulfur, barium and silver were extracted from these rugged hills but transporting them was a logistical nightmare. In 1924, Italian engineer Cesare Vecelli revolutionised ore transport in the region. He designed Porto Flavia as a system of tunnels and silos carved into a limestone cliff, allowing ore to be loaded directly onto cargo ships. The port, named after Vecelli's daughter, Flavia, remained in use until mining declined in the mid-20th century.","date":"May 14, 2025","bsTitle":"Ore and more","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250513_SardiniaFlavia%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"06694c718e4a136ff5cd013b68e6ce27","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SardiniaFlavia_EN-IN6165553665_tmb.jpg","title":"Porto Flavia, Sulcis-Iglesiente, Sardinia, Italy","desc":"Most ports rely on docks and cranes that extend into the shoreline.

The genus is named after the Greek word 'îris', meaning 'rainbow,' which is also the name of the Greek goddess of rainbows. During the Edo Period (1603-1867), a fascination with breeding Japanese irises led to an explosion of new varieties. Today, there are over 2,000 types, which are planted in March and nurtured by tsuyu, Japan's rainy season.
