Donkeys have a reputation for being stubborn, but that's just a misunderstanding. They're actually cautious thinkers. Unlike horses, which might bolt at danger, donkeys take a moment to assess the situation before reacting. From ancient trade routes to modern farms, donkeys have been essential to transportation and agriculture. In many parts of the world, they're still the backbone of rural economies, carrying supplies across difficult terrain where vehicles can't go. Despite their vital role, donkeys face serious challenges. Many endure overwork, poor treatment, and abandonment.","date":"May 8, 2025","bsTitle":"A day to bray about","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250508_RhyoliteDonkeys%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"81f4b70c19ead381660f0afcb3cb9e71","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.RhyoliteDonkeys_EN-US6439068828_tmb.jpg","title":"World Donkey Day","desc":"On May 8 each year, donkeys get their moment in the sun—though they'd probably prefer the shade.

This holiday is often mistaken for Mexican Independence Day, but that falls on September 16. Instead, Cinco de Mayo honors Mexico's fight against foreign rule and symbolizes resilience and unity. The battle itself was brief, lasting from daybreak to early evening, but the Mexican army, led by General Ignacio Zaragoza, managed to defeat a much larger and better-equipped French force. Today, Cinco de Mayo festivities feature parades, mariachi music, folk dancing, and delicious foods like tacos and mole poblano.
