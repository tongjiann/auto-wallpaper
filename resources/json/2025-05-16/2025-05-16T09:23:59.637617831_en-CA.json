Well, you are not alone. Today, there are more than 3,000 registered varieties of tulips grown around the world. Originally found in the wild across Central Asia, tulips were cultivated by the Ottomans as early as the 10th century. These flowers made their way into Europe during the 16th century after being introduced through diplomatic and trade routes. By the 1630s, the Netherlands experienced tulip mania, one of the first recorded economic bubbles, where single bulbs could sell for more than a skilled worker's annual salary.","date":"May 9, 2025","bsTitle":"It's tulip season","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250509_Tulip25Fest%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"30b3a076254ade6f7c3d7ab5032d727e","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.Tulip25Fest_EN-CA8965169062_tmb.jpg","title":"Canadian Tulip Festival","desc":"Ever spotted a field full of tulips and felt like you'd stepped into a painting?

World Donkey Day, established by Dr. Abdul Raziq Kakar, a livestock expert from Pakistan, is all about celebrating these hardworking animals. Donkeys have a reputation for being stubborn, but that's just a misunderstanding. They're actually cautious thinkers. Unlike horses, which might bolt at danger, donkeys take a moment to assess the situation before reacting. From ancient trade routes to modern farms, donkeys have been essential to transportation and agriculture. In many parts of the world, they're still the backbone of rural economies, carrying supplies across difficult terrain where vehicles can't go. Despite their vital role, donkeys face serious challenges. Many endure overwork, poor treatment and abandonment.","date":"May 8, 2025","bsTitle":"A day to bray about","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250508_RhyoliteDonkeys%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"dfa4f5822e955b49c8cca7ca46b7de96","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.RhyoliteDonkeys_EN-CA1691842106_tmb.jpg","title":"World Donkey Day","desc":"On May 8 each year, donkeys get their moment in the sun—though they'd probably prefer the shade.
