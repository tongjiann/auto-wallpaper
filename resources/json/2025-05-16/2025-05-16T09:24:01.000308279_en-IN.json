But every May 9, these masters of disguise can't hide from the spotlight. International Chameleon Day celebrates their colour-shifting skills, zippy tongues and wild adaptations. With over 200 species found in diverse habitats, these reptiles don't change colour to match their background. Instead, their shifting shades help regulate body temperature, attract mates and communicate with others. Specialised skin cells, including iridophores, reflect light to create dazzling displays. Some species turn bright to signal aggression, while others adopt subdued tones to avoid attention.","date":"May 9, 2025","bsTitle":"Blending in and standing out","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250508_CuteChameleon%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"b8cd3f1bd9dc7ad5e41ea602af989246","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CuteChameleon_EN-IN3680584611_tmb.jpg","title":"International Chameleon Day","desc":"One moment they're blending in, the next they're flaunting a new shade—chameleons really know how to colour the world.

World Donkey Day, established by Dr. Abdul Raziq Kakar, a livestock expert from Pakistan, is all about celebrating these hardworking animals. Donkeys have a reputation for being stubborn, but that's just a misunderstanding. They're cautious thinkers. Unlike horses, which might bolt at danger, donkeys take a moment to assess the situation before reacting. From ancient trade routes to modern farms, donkeys have been essential to transportation and agriculture. In many parts of the world, they're still the backbone of rural economies, carrying supplies across difficult terrain where vehicles can't go. Despite their vital role, donkeys face serious challenges. Many endure overwork, poor treatment and abandonment.","date":"May 8, 2025","bsTitle":"A day to bray about","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250507_RhyoliteDonkeys%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"4a1e9b75bbb9e722dd49af3cff6d3a17","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.RhyoliteDonkeys_EN-IN2213858489_tmb.jpg","title":"World Donkey Day","desc":"On May 8 each year, donkeys get their moment in the sun—though they'd probably prefer the shade.
