That's why April 18 is the International Day for Monuments and Sites, an event recognised by UNESCO dedicated to protecting cultural treasures worldwide. This day is all about celebrating our history, raising awareness about endangered sites and making sure future generations can enjoy them too. A remarkable example is Göreme Historical National Park in Cappadocia, Türkiye. It's famous for its 'fairy chimneys'—towering rock formations shaped by volcanic ash and erosion over thousands of years. People even carved homes, churches and entire underground cities into these soft rock formations, some dating back to the 4th century. Today, it's a UNESCO World Heritage Site, attracting visitors from around the world.","date":"Apr 18, 2025","bsTitle":"Celebrating history","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250417_GoremeTurkey%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"4f01efc949772b595b2020876b8a85bf","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.GoremeTurkey_EN-IN8119524703_tmb.jpg","title":"International Day for Monuments and Sites","desc":"Imagine a world without the pyramids, the Great Wall or ancient cave cities—hard to picture, right?

Kachina, pictured here, is equidistant from Sipapu and Owachomo. It was named after the petroglyphs and pictographs found at its base. Owachomo is believed to be the oldest of the three.

During this time, people visit temples, offer food to monks and pour scented water over Buddha statues and elders' hands as a sign of respect. Those seeking a calmer way to celebrate might consider visiting Wat Tang Sai Temple in Ban Krut, seen in today's image. Perched on Thong Chai Mountain, this temple complex is home to an over 10-metre-tall Buddha statue and Thai-style pagodas. Built in 1996 to honour King Bhumibol Adulyadej (Rama IX) on his 50th year of reign (1946–2016), it remains an important spiritual site. With stunning coastline views, Wat Tang Sai offers a peaceful setting to meditate and feel the vibrations of Buddhist chants.","date":"Apr 13, 2025","bsTitle":"Let's celebrate Songkran!","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250412_ThailandPagodas%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"83964a9ebec103e3ee5bed0a4de71ea8","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ThailandPagodas_EN-IN4796043507_tmb.jpg","title":"Songkran—Thai New Year","desc":"New Year celebrations don't always come with fireworks—sometimes, they come with buckets and a nationwide water splash fest!
