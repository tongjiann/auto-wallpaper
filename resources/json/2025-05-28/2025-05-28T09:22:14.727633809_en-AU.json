With 13 species worldwide, including the European otter, giant otter and sea otter—pictured here—these semi-aquatic animals are adapted for life in water. Their webbed feet, dense fur and strong tails make them excellent swimmers.

The park shelters red foxes, Arctic foxes, lemmings and red deer, while its flora includes hardy alpine species adapted to extreme conditions. Flowing through the park, the Gjende lake is famous for its striking green colour, caused by glacial sediments. Stretching about 18 kilometres in length and around a kilometre at its widest point, the lake sits at around 1,000 metres above sea level.
