This holiday is often mistaken for Mexican Independence Day, but that falls on September 16. Instead, Cinco de Mayo honors Mexico's fight against foreign rule and symbolizes resilience and unity. The battle itself was brief, lasting from daybreak to early evening, but the Mexican army, led by General Ignacio Zaragoza, managed to defeat a much larger and better-equipped French force. Today, Cinco de Mayo festivities feature parades, mariachi music, folk dancing, and delicious foods like tacos and mole poblano.

Since 1928, this Hawaiian tradition has been in full bloom, with leis—or garlands made of flowers, leaves, or shells—serving as symbols of connection.
