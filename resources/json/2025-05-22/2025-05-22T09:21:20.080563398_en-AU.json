In 2012, officials renamed the Clock Tower as Elizabeth Tower to honour Queen Elizabeth II during her Diamond Jubilee. The clock has stopped only for maintenance and rare disruptions, such as bomb damage during World Wars I and II. Each of its four clock faces spans nearly 7 metres, with the minute hands measuring approximately 4 metres. At 96 metres tall, the tower is part of the grand Palace of Westminster, home to the UK Parliament.","date":"15 May 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250515_LondonParliament%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"17c52621d28a4b54a5fd36155da627a3","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LondonParliament_ROW3873497471_tmb.jpg","title":"Palace of Westminster, London, England","desc":"London's most famous clock tower isn't called Big Ben—that name belongs to the massive 13.5-ton bell inside.

Lead, zinc, coal, sulphur, barium and silver were extracted from these rugged hills, but transporting them was a logistical nightmare. Ore had to be hauled by cart, loaded onto small boats and then transferred to larger ships—a slow, costly and inefficient process.","date":"14 May 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250514_SardiniaFlavia%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"19ad757f46608ecfd79a759987198563","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SardiniaFlavia_ROW1636394232_tmb.jpg","title":"Porto Flavia, Sulcis-Iglesiente, Sardinia, Italy","desc":"Most ports rely on docks and cranes that extend into the shoreline.
