Its slender, muscular body can reach a length of over 180 centimetres, complemented by a long tail measuring around 1 metre and a shoulder height of 60 centimetres. A skilled and opportunistic hunter, it preys on a wide range of animals, like impalas, warthogs and even baboons.

Native to the Mediterranean Basin and areas around the Red Sea, it holds the unique distinction of being the only living member of the Chamaeleonidae family with a range that naturally extends into Europe. Did you know? These reptiles don't change colour to match their background. Instead, their shifting shades help regulate body temperature, attract mates and communicate with others. Specialised skin cells, including iridophores, reflect light to create dazzling displays. Some species turn bright to signal aggression, while others adopt subdued tones to avoid attention.","date":"9 May 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250509_CuteChameleon%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"1c07a3f9efe6371a0c50067c371992b7","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CuteChameleon_ROW1187916119_tmb.jpg","title":"Common chameleon","desc":"Chameleons are remarkable creatures, best known for their ability to change colour and their distinctive physical traits.
