Since 1928, this Hawaiian tradition has been in full bloom, with leis—or garlands made of flowers, leaves, or shells—serving as symbols of connection. The idea for Lei Day came from poet Don Blanding, who suggested a holiday dedicated to Hawaii's iconic floral garlands.

Since it was first documented in 1823, volcanic activity has caused the crater to fill with lava, partially collapse, erupt in fountains of lava, expand to twice its size on two occasions, and at times fill with groundwater. All this activity demonstrates the unpredictable raw power that lies below the surface of the Earth.
