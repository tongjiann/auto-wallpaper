Plastic contamination has crept into every part of the world—from oceans and forests to our own bodies in the form of microplastics.

On the island's eastern coast lies Cala Luna, featured here—a beach in the Gulf of Orosei. Rising at the mouth of Rio Illune, this beach is at the end of the Codula di Luna canyon. It is a haven of golden sand, surrounded by white cliffs that rise more than 250 metres into the sky—perfect for rock climbing. Here, the waters are shallow at first, before deepening into crystal-clear depths ideal for snorkelling, diving and fishing. In the local Nuoro dialect, the word for 'Luna,' meaning 'moon', is rendered as 'elune,' a name that perfectly captures the essence of this enchanting cove. Adding to the mystique, the beach's crescent shape echoes its lunar inspiration. For centuries, shepherds from the village of Baunei would embark on an eight-hour walk to reach this secluded spot, considering it a journey as far as the moon itself.","date":"Jun 4, 2025","bsTitle":"Crisp blues, sharp views","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250603_CalaLuna%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"b4e942ded9b04ef7cb7cbde51fb140fa","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CalaLuna_EN-IN7826704026_tmb.jpg","title":"Cala Luna beach, Sardinia, Italy","desc":"The island of Sardinia in Italy, with its rugged cliffs, secret beaches and endless shades of blue, is undeniably a Mediterranean treasure…","hash":"xZ7AS3KBk3dHaz5TwPe/A0aAa12jy3zajrSlfzBFaMQ="}},{"startdate":"20250602","fullstartdate":"202506021830","enddate":"20250603","url":"/th?id=OHR.BicyclesUtrecht_EN-IN7690250347_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.BicyclesUtrecht_EN-IN7690250347","copyright":"Bicycles on a bridge in Utrecht, Netherlands (© George Pachantouris/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=World+Bicycle+Day&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220250602_1830%22","title":"Brake for joy","caption":"World Bicycle Day","copyrightonly":"© George Pachantouris/Getty Images","desc":"Two wheels, no fuel and a whole lot of purpose—cycling is affordable, eco-friendly and easy on the planet.

The steady ripple, the splash of trout, the distant laughter of hikers. That's the Little Pigeon River, threading its way through the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in Tennessee, United States. Long before tourists tubed it and fly fishers praised it, this river was how people stayed afloat. The Cherokee tribe fished in it. Settlers built grist mills along it. Towns like Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge grew up with it. Even the river's name is a nod to the past—the passenger pigeon, once common in the area, vanished by the early 1900s. The West, Middle and East prongs come together to form a system that cuts through the Smokies and flows into the Pigeon River. Trails like the Gatlinburg Trail run alongside the river, offering flat paths with water views and shady rest spots. Some hikes, like the Ramsey Cascades trail, follow the river deeper into the park and reward you with impressive waterfalls.","date":"May 30, 2025","bsTitle":"Flowing through the Smokies","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250529_LittlePigeonRiver%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"608dadb371ba5d6783ea5ebaf0c21291","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LittlePigeonRiver_EN-IN3037578886_tmb.jpg","title":"Little Pigeon River, Great Smoky Mountains National Park, United States","desc":"Blink and you miss it—until you hear it.
