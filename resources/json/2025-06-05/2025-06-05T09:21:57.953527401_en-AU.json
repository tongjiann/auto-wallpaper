With a height of approximately 100 metres, the access trail begins in the village of Baixão and is considered challenging due to its steep sections. The sound of the cascading water echoes through the canyon, providing a unique sensory experience. Surrounding the waterfall, a diverse range of wildlife—including exotic birds and small mammals—enhances the feeling of being in a pristine, untouched wilderness.","date":"5 Jun 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250605_FumacinhaBahia%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"dbc472e55785e4ea570707cbcc130560","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.FumacinhaBahia_ROW1478694911_tmb.jpg","title":"Fumacinha Waterfall, Chapada Diamantina, Brazil","desc":"Today's image takes us to Fumacinha Waterfall, one of the most beautiful yet least explored waterfalls in Chapada Diamantina National Park…","hash":"I9CIGyS26j0y+4p8PGC2orsht/35CX2k9mvsYc6FHXQ="}},{"startdate":"20250604","fullstartdate":"202506040700","enddate":"20250605","url":"/th?id=OHR.SchlossMoritzburg_ROW1385647959_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.SchlossMoritzburg_ROW1385647959","copyright":"Moritzburg Castle, Saxony, Germany (© Hans-Peter Szyszka/eStock Photo)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Moritzburg+Castle&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220250604_0700%22","title":"Info","caption":"Moritzburg Castle, Saxony, Germany","copyrightonly":"© Hans-Peter Szyszka/eStock Photo","desc":"Nestled in a picturesque pond landscape just a few kilometres from Dresden, Germany, Moritzburg Castle stands proudly, as seen in today's image.

Today, it impresses visitors with its Baroque architecture and idyllic location on an artificial island. Majestic towers and halls, furnished with precious furniture and trophies, bear witness to the former splendour of the Saxon court. It is no wonder that this castle is not only the landmark of the town of the same name but is also regarded as one of the most beautiful Baroque castles in Germany.","date":"4 Jun 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250604_SchlossMoritzburg%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"11aa8b0adf11a3243e9372c972109dc5","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SchlossMoritzburg_ROW1385647959_tmb.jpg","title":"Moritzburg Castle, Saxony, Germany","desc":"Nestled in a picturesque pond landscape just a few kilometres from Dresden, Germany, Moritzburg Castle stands proudly, as seen in today's…","hash":"n/GQMfrQLA3yDHC/0AnSRvKJU4xG9PhTAyUPqE750m0="}},{"startdate":"20250603","fullstartdate":"202506030700","enddate":"20250604","url":"/th?id=OHR.BicyclesUtrecht_ROW1292854784_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.BicyclesUtrecht_ROW1292854784","copyright":"Bicycles on a bridge in Utrecht, Netherlands (© George Pachantouris/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=bicycle&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220250603_0700%22","title":"Info","caption":"Bicycles on a bridge in Utrecht, Netherlands","copyrightonly":"© George Pachantouris/Getty Images","desc":"Two wheels, no fuel and a whole lot of purpose—cycling is affordable, eco-friendly and easy on the planet.

Native to North America, Echinacea is loved by both gardeners and pollinators for its hardy blooms. Its name comes from the Greek word 'ekhinos,' meaning 'hedgehog,' referring to its spiky centre. These flowers bloom during summer, providing long-lasting colour and attracting bees, butterflies and hummingbirds. They are also appreciated for their low-maintenance nature and ability to naturalize. Unfortunately, wild Echinacea populations are under growing threat from excessive harvesting. In addition, habitat loss and environmental changes caused by human activity also threaten the long-term survival of some species.","date":"2 Jun 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250602_EchinaceaButterfly%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"13197ce78f65c49bc3684f8fbb140504","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.EchinaceaButterfly_ROW1204867098_tmb.jpg","title":"Skipper butterfly on an Echinacea flower","desc":"Pictured here is a skipper butterfly, known for its quick, darting flight, resting on a vibrant Echinacea, or coneflower, at Rockefeller…","hash":"D+gXzJDLhV0fPrO4MuxEkWREsjymn256bsCFqj9kpnw="}},{"startdate":"20250601","fullstartdate":"202506010700","enddate":"20250602","url":"/th?id=OHR.GrandeTerreReef_ROW1096147222_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.GrandeTerreReef_ROW1096147222","copyright":"Barrier reef off Grande Terre, New Caledonia, France (© Karsten Wrobel/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=New+Caledonian+barrier+reef&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220250601_0700%22","title":"Info","caption":"Barrier reef off Grande Terre, New Caledonia, France","copyrightonly":"© Karsten Wrobel/Getty Images","desc":"'Life under the sea is better than anything they got up there,' Sebastian the crab once told Ariel.
