They offer the perfect refuge from the summer heat and crowded beaches. Each tower has its own story to tell: of ancient civilisations, adventurous hikers, daring climbers and distant battles. Shaped by time and weather, these Dolomite spires played a strategic role during the First World War, and it is still possible today to explore the trenches and remnants of that conflict-scarred past. However, nature is stronger than history: green pastures embrace the towers, the wind carries the scent of pines and a clear sky opens above paths that beckon you to explore. Streams meander through flower-filled meadows while birdsong accompanies every step.","date":"Jun 14, 2025","bsTitle":"The sounds of silence","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250613_DolomitiEstate%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"5763fb075b26544ddfd6c3c7f5f8664a","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.DolomitiEstate_EN-IN7937552367_tmb.jpg","title":"Cinque Torri, Dolomiti, Cortina d'Ampezzo, Belluno, Veneto, Italy","desc":"The Five Towers, known as 'Fünf Türme' in German and 'Cinc Toires' in Ladin, rise majestically in the heart of the Dolomites in the province…","hash":"iGCmpAGY/4fA+iy+gIl1RKSXrkYs81kO9A/iSB91b50="}},{"startdate":"20250612","fullstartdate":"202506121830","enddate":"20250613","url":"/th?id=OHR.SanMiguelAzores_EN-IN2966282396_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.SanMiguelAzores_EN-IN2966282396","copyright":"Vila Franca Islet, São Miguel Island, Azores, Portugal (© ARoxo/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Vila+Franca+Islet&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220250612_1830%22","title":"The ocean's hidden heartbeat","caption":"Vila Franca Islet, São Miguel Island, Azores, Portugal","copyrightonly":"© ARoxo/Getty Images","desc":"Not far from São Miguel Island in the Azores archipelago of Portugal, you'll find Vila Franca Islet.

The unique shape of this tiny island, sculpted by nature, makes it truly special. At its heart lies an almost perfectly circular lagoon, linked to the sea by a narrow channel called Boquete.

The more they eat, the pinker they get. In other words, they're what they eat, right down to the blush. In the air, flamingos are sleek flyers, cruising long distances in a V-formation.
