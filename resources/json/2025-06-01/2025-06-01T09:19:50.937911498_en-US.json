One magnificent example is the New Caledonian barrier reef, which wraps around Grande Terre, New Caledonia's largest island. At over 930 miles long, it's one of the longest continuous barrier reefs in the world. Its vast 9,300-square-mile lagoon is home to over 2,300 fish species, endangered dugongs, green sea turtles, and migrating humpback whales.","date":"Jun 1, 2025","bsTitle":"Under the sea","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250601_GrandeTerreReef%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"a55a59757426003d3f7e483d6ec38c44","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.GrandeTerreReef_EN-US8351815569_tmb.jpg","title":"World Reef Awareness Day","desc":"'Life under the sea is better than anything they got up there,' Sebastian the crab once told Ariel.

Built in the 1930s during the Depression, it was carved out of a natural rock shelf as part of an unemployment relief scheme. Upgraded over time, the pool is nearly 100 feet long and flanked by a smaller children's pool. The pools are free, open year-round, and cleaned regularly by both council crews and the ocean itself.
