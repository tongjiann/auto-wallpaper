Lead, zinc, coal, sulphur, barium and silver were extracted from these rugged hills but transporting them was a logistical nightmare. Ore had to be hauled by cart, loaded onto small boats and then transferred to larger ships—a slow, costly and inefficient process.","date":"May 14, 2025","bsTitle":"Ore and more","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250514_SardiniaFlavia%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"86e3bb45c2f4659faf4b44cba0a8de7f","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SardiniaFlavia_EN-CA3349516488_tmb.jpg","title":"Porto Flavia, Sulcis-Iglesiente, Sardinia, Italy","desc":"Most ports rely on docks and cranes that extend into the shoreline.

Unlike horses, which might bolt at danger, donkeys take a moment to assess the situation before reacting. From ancient trade routes to modern farms, donkeys have been essential to transportation and agriculture. In many parts of the world, they're still the backbone of rural economies, carrying supplies across difficult terrain where vehicles can't go.
