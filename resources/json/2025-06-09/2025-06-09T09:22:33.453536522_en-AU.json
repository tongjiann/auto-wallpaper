Native to North America, Echinacea is loved by both gardeners and pollinators for its hardy blooms. Its name comes from the Greek word 'ekhinos,' meaning 'hedgehog,' referring to its spiky centre. These flowers bloom during summer, providing long-lasting colour and attracting bees, butterflies and hummingbirds. They are also appreciated for their low-maintenance nature and ability to naturalize. Unfortunately, wild Echinacea populations are under growing threat from excessive harvesting. In addition, habitat loss and environmental changes caused by human activity also threaten the long-term survival of some species.","date":"2 Jun 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250602_EchinaceaButterfly%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"13197ce78f65c49bc3684f8fbb140504","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.EchinaceaButterfly_ROW1204867098_tmb.jpg","title":"Skipper butterfly on an Echinacea flower","desc":"Pictured here is a skipper butterfly, known for its quick, darting flight, resting on a vibrant Echinacea, or coneflower, at Rockefeller…","hash":"D+gXzJDLhV0fPrO4MuxEkWREsjymn256bsCFqj9kpnw="}},{"startdate":"20250601","fullstartdate":"202506010700","enddate":"20250602","url":"/th?id=OHR.GrandeTerreReef_ROW1096147222_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.GrandeTerreReef_ROW1096147222","copyright":"Barrier reef off Grande Terre, New Caledonia, France (© Karsten Wrobel/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=New+Caledonian+barrier+reef&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220250601_0700%22","title":"Info","caption":"Barrier reef off Grande Terre, New Caledonia, France","copyrightonly":"© Karsten Wrobel/Getty Images","desc":"'Life under the sea is better than anything they got up there,' Sebastian the crab once told Ariel.
