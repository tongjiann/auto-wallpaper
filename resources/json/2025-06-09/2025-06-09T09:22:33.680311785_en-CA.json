With just over 2,000 residents spread across 11 tight-knit outports, life here moves to its own rhythm. From Tilting to Joe Batt's Arm, these settlements were founded by Irish and English fishers centuries ago. The traditions they introduced can still be witnessed in the island festivals like mummering in winter, boat launches in summer and kitchen parties year-round. Fishing was the backbone for generations, and even now, the sea's pulse is never far off.","date":"Jun. 2, 2025","bsTitle":"To all the bright places","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250602_Fogoisland%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"b6607d2e5fa18f01fc7ca5091090908c","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.Fogoisland_EN-CA7909293676_tmb.jpg","title":"Fogo Island, Newfoundland and Labrador","desc":"It is easy to call a place remote.

Built in the 1930s during the Depression, it was carved out of a natural rock shelf as part of an unemployment relief scheme. Upgraded over time, the pool is more than 30 metres long and flanked by a smaller children's pool. The pools were also used by large numbers of World War II troops who camped nearby. They are free, open year-round and cleaned regularly by both council crews and the ocean itself. So next time you are in Sydney, make a splash where the waves meet the wall.
