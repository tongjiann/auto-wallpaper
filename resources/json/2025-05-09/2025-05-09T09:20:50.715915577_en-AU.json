With over 200 species spread across a variety of habitats, they showcase an incredible range of diversity. Among them, the common chameleon, also known as the Mediterranean chameleon, stands out. Native to the Mediterranean Basin and areas around the Red Sea, it holds the unique distinction of being the only living member of the Chamaeleonidae family with a range that naturally extends into Europe. Did you know? These reptiles don't change colour to match their background. Instead, their shifting shades help regulate body temperature, attract mates and communicate with others. Specialised skin cells, including iridophores, reflect light to create dazzling displays. Some species turn bright to signal aggression, while others adopt subdued tones to avoid attention.","date":"9 May 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250509_CuteChameleon%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"1c07a3f9efe6371a0c50067c371992b7","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CuteChameleon_ROW1187916119_tmb.jpg","title":"Common chameleon","desc":"Chameleons are remarkable creatures, best known for their ability to change colour and their distinctive physical traits.

In many parts of the world, they're still the backbone of rural economies, carrying supplies across difficult terrain where vehicles can't go.
