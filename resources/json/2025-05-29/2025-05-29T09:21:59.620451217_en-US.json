As Spain's longest river, the Ebro winds through tales of Iberians, Romans, Moors, and Knights Templar. Locals once relied on its waters for trade, transport, and even defense. Today, you'll spot kayakers, ferry boats, and visitors drifting through the same currents where Crusaders once crossed.","date":"May 29, 2025","bsTitle":"Flowing through the centuries","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250529_MiravetSpain%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"f9f3c63e04857d6bdc98cd59f71a4d30","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MiravetSpain_EN-US4967052818_tmb.jpg","title":"Miravet, Catalonia, Spain","desc":"Some towns live in the present.

Enter Mona Vale Rockpool in Sydney, Australia—a watery paradox where the ocean is wild beyond the walls and well-behaved within its calm, contained edges. Perched in Sydney's Northern Beaches area—this rock pool feels more like a natural wonder than a human-made one. Built in the 1930s during the Depression, it was carved out of a natural rock shelf as part of an unemployment relief scheme. Upgraded over time, the pool is nearly 100 feet long and flanked by a smaller children's pool. The pools are free, open year-round, and cleaned regularly by both council crews and the ocean itself.
